# Contributing to Dialogue Manager

G'day! I'm thrilled that you want to contribute to Dialogue Manager. The community is what makes Godot and Godot projects great.

## How to send in your contributions

Contributions come in all shapes and sizes. You can report a bug, improve documentation, or submit a pull request (though, for new feature pull requests, check with Nathan before putting in too much effort in case it's not something that will get merged).

### Reporting bugs and opening issues

Please [report bugs](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/issues) and open issues generously. Don't be too afraid that your idea might be silly or that you're reporting a duplicate. I don't expect everyone to be experts in Dialogue Manager lore.

> ***Please Note:*** Dialogue Manager is written by volunteers. If you encounter a problem while using it, we'll do our best to help you, but nobody is under any actual obligation.

### Submitting a pull request

* [Fork](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/fork) and clone the repository ([GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) makes this easy).
* Create a new branch.
* Make your changes.
* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/compare).
* Wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

If you're unfamiliar with how pull requests work, [GitHub's documentation on them](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) is very good.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Update the documentation of anything affected by your change.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* Make sure your pull request is in a merge-able state (GitHub will tell you if there will be merge conflicts).

### Branches

All of Dialogue Manager's in-progress work happens on the `main` branch. When I make a release, it will come directly from `main`. This means that `main` is always in a state of flux.

### Code and other contributions

Contributions to Dialogue Manager (via pull request or otherwise) must be licensed under the MIT license.
