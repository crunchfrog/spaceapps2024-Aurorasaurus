Radio reporter: Good morning. From NPR News in Washington, I’m Steve Inskeep. It’s Friday, May 10th. Today, we’re following a developing story of a series of powerful coronal mass ejections, which are expected to impact Earth later tonight, causing potential disruptions to power grids and communications.
Radio reporter: Experts are urging precautions as we await the arrival of these geomagnetic storms. "We have high confidence that a series of coronal mass ejections are directed right towards Earth," says Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center told reporters early Friday.
